# Duplicate Header Fix

## Issue Description
After the React conversion, users reported seeing two "Live CloudEvents Stream" headers in the UI, which created a confusing and redundant experience.

## Root Cause Analysis
The duplication occurred because both the parent `App.tsx` and the child `CloudEventsStream.tsx` component were rendering their own headers:

1. **App.tsx** was rendering a blue "🔴 Live CloudEvents Stream" header
2. **CloudEventsStream.tsx** was rendering both:
   - An `<h3>Live CloudEvents Stream</h3>` title
   - Another blue "🔴 Live CloudEvents Stream" div inside the event list

## The Fix

### Updated CloudEventsStream Component
- Added optional `showHeader` prop (defaults to `true` for backward compatibility)
- Made the header rendering conditional based on this prop
- Removed the duplicate blue header div that was appearing inside the event list
- Maintained flexibility for standalone usage

### Updated App.tsx
- Added `showHeader={false}` to both snapshot and live CloudEventsStream instances
- Kept the blue live indicator in the parent component for better visual hierarchy
- Added descriptive text under the live indicator for clarity

## Code Changes

### CloudEventsStream.tsx
```typescript
interface CloudEventsStreamProps {
  events: CloudEvent[];
  isSnapshot: boolean;
  showHeader?: boolean;  // NEW: Optional header control
}

const CloudEventsStream: React.FC<CloudEventsStreamProps> = ({
  events,
  isSnapshot,
  showHeader = true,  // NEW: Default to true
}) => {
  // ...
  
  {showHeader && (  // NEW: Conditional header rendering
    <>
      <h3>Live CloudEvents Stream</h3>
      <p>Immutable event log - new events appear in real-time via SSE</p>
    </>
  )}
  
  // REMOVED: Duplicate blue header div from event list
};
```

### App.tsx
```typescript
{/* Historical Events */}
<CloudEventsStream
  events={snapshotEvents}
  isSnapshot={true}
  showHeader={false}  // NEW: Parent handles header
/>

{/* Live Events */}
<div style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
  <div style={{ /* Blue header styling */ }}>
    🔴 Live CloudEvents Stream
  </div>
  <p>New events appear in real-time via Server-Sent Events</p>
  <CloudEventsStream
    events={liveEvents}
    isSnapshot={false}
    showHeader={false}  // NEW: Parent handles header
  />
</div>
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### ✅ User Experience
- **Clear hierarchy** - Single, prominent live indicator
- **No confusion** - Eliminated duplicate headers
- **Better visual flow** - Consistent header styling across sections

### ✅ Code Quality  
- **Flexible component** - CloudEventsStream can work standalone or embedded
- **Single responsibility** - Parent controls layout, child handles rendering
- **Backward compatibility** - Existing usage still works (showHeader defaults to true)

### ✅ Maintainability
- **Centralized control** - Headers managed in one place (App.tsx)
- **Reusable component** - CloudEventsStream works in different contexts
- **Clear prop interface** - Intent is explicit with showHeader prop

## Visual Result

### Before Fix
```
📸 Snapshot: 10 existing CloudEvents
[events list]

Live CloudEvents Stream            ← App.tsx header
Live CloudEvents Stream            ← Component header (duplicate!)
New events appear in real-time...
🔴 Live CloudEvents Stream         ← Inside event list (triplicate!)
[events list]
```

### After Fix  
```
📸 Snapshot: 10 existing CloudEvents
[events list]

🔴 Live CloudEvents Stream         ← Single, clear header
New events appear in real-time via Server-Sent Events
[events list]
```

## Testing
- ✅ React build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Component props are type-safe
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for standalone usage
- ✅ Visual hierarchy is now clean and intuitive

This fix improves the user experience while maintaining clean, flexible component architecture.
